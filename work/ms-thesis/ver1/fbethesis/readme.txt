The file fbeman.tex is a user's guide for this package. So, first compile it with
LaTeX to find out how to use the fbe_tez package.

Note that this is a beta version of fbe_tez which is still under development and
has not been yet officially approved by the FBE Executive Council. Nevertheless,
the author has made his best to include all the changes in the thesis format which
has been updated by FBE in 2003. He would be also happy to help you if you have
any question on fbe_tez.

Changes in Version 3.1:

* Spacing before and after the headings of all sectional units have been tuned
  much finer in this version.

* Interparagraph spacing and paragraph indentation has also been corrected.

* A period after the figure or table number in the list of table and figures,
  respectively was missing. It is now there.

* The spaces of between figures and their captions are now a bit smaller.

Changes in Version 3.2:

* The spacings related to listings (such as itemized or enumerated lists) have
  been corrected. You can now nest up to three listings into each other with
  correct paragraph and inter-item spacing.

* The Appendix titles were erronously being produced with a dot (rather than a
  column) after the appendix number. This error has been removed.

Changes in Version 4.0:

* The command \makeproposaltitle is introduced for generating title page of a
  Ph.D. proposal. That means fbe_tez can now be used to typeset proposals, too.

Changes in Version 4.1:

* A small error in the indentation of the "Figure" and "Table" in the List
  of Figures and List of Tables is detected and corrected.

* Now you get the correct tabbing position for all lines in the List of Symbols
  if the description of a symbol or abbreviation is longer than that would fit
  in a single line. Unfortunately, you do not get the correct line spacing
  after such a description line. So, please give a hand to fbe_tez by putting
  a small amount of vertical space whenever necessary.

* New environments "abbreviations" and "symabbreviations" are now available
  to generate lists with headings as "List of Abbreviations" and "List of
  Symbols/Abbbreviations".

* "Quote" and "quotations" environments now typesets the quoted text in 10
  points, as required in the format booklet.

Changes in Version 4.2:

* The wording and spacing of the title pages are changed so as to comply with
  the updates introduced in 2003 by the FBE Executive Council.

Thanks to everybody who used the style and fed me back.

Please report any further bugs to kerestec@boun.edu.tr.
