Torque = (HP x 5252) / rpm
Horsepower = watts, the same thing.
Horsepower = 33,000 lb-ft per minute

While the majority of motors used in servo systems are brushless
designs, brushed permanent magnet DC motors are sometimes employed as
servo motors for their simplicity and low cost. The most common type
of brushed DC motor used in servo applications is the permanent magnet
DC (PMDC) motor

Motor, KV

Kv refers to the constant velocity of a motor (not to be confused with
“kV,” the abbreviation for kilovolt). It is measured by the number of
revolutions per minute (rpm) that a motor turns when 1V (one volt) is
applied with no load attached to that motor. The Kv rating of a
brushless motor is the ratio of the motor’s unloaded rpm to the peak
voltage on the wires connected to the coils.

Knowing the Kv rating of a motor will help you determine how fast that
motor will rotate when a given voltage is applied to it. For example,
a 980Kv motor powered by an 11.1V battery would spin at 10,878 rpm
(980 x 11.1) with no load

BEMF zero cross detection driving is a brushless 3 phase motor driving
method that relies on estimating the rotors position by using voltage
generated by the motor’s rotation. Naturally, brushless motors
generate voltage when rotating similar to how a generator produces
power. This voltage generated by the brushless motor is called
BEMF. During operation, it is possible to view the BEMF signal of a DC
3 phase brushless DC motor on a disconnected phase.

The vast majority of robots today are driven by rotary electric motors
(Fig. 9.1). Large industrial robots typically use brushless servo
motors while small laboratory or hobby robots use brushed DC motors or
stepper motors
