f : Full resolution.  These contain the maximum resolution
    of this data and has not been decimated.
    
h : High resolution.  The Douglas-Peucker line reduction was
    used to reduce data size by ~80% relative to full.
    
i : Intermediate resolution.  The Douglas-Peucker line reduction was
    used to reduce data size by ~80% relative to high.
    
l : Low resolution.  The Douglas-Peucker line reduction was
    used to reduce data size by ~80% relative to intermediate.
    
c : Crude resolution.  The Douglas-Peucker line reduction was
    used to reduce data size by ~80% relative to low.
