A[s] soon as you add sprites or anything that moves to a [game] world
you start to think about detecting collisions and doing this
efficiently remains an interesting area of development with different
approaches being more or less optimal for different conditions. It’s
essentially a spatial organisation problem. As such although you might
think “huh, collision detection, what use is that to me?” it’s not
hard to see how similar indexing approaches can be useful in answering
similar questions not involving games. Similarly although the A*
algorithm, for example, is traditionally thought of as a gaming
algorithm I’ve found myself using it in some very interesting
none-gaming spaces.

In the case of collisions between sprites in my [engine] I need to
consider hundreds of objects made up of, in sum, millions of [parts]
spread across an indeterminate, but essentially very large and mostly
sparse, three dimensional space.. [P]erfect detection between every
one of those sprites is clearly going to be horrifically expensive and
so typically collision detection is broken down into two phases:

Broad range collisions – quickly draw up a shortlist of probable
collisions.  Narrow range collisions – use additional detail to filter
the probably collisions resulting from the broad range pass into the
actual pixel / [object] perfect collisions.  My first attempt at
solving the broad range problem in my engine is a common one and takes
advantage of an efficient means of determining if two boxes (2d or 3d)
intersect that relies on them being axis aligned – hence the axis
aligned bounding box, or AABB. If that sounds complicated – don’t
worry, it isn’t and I’ll explain it later.

There are many implementations of this available online and various
blog posts and tutorials but I didn’t find anything that brought it
all together and so what follows is a step by step guide to AABBs and
how to sort them in a tree to quickly determine intersections. There
is sample code provided in the form of the C++ implementation in my
engine and at the bottom of this post I explain how you can use this
(just the AABB tree implementation) in your own code. However this
post is more about the theory and once you understand that a simple
implementation is fairly straightforward (though there are numerous
optimisations, some of which are in my sample code some of which
aren’t, that can complicate things).

For the purposes of keeping this guide simple I’m going to draw
diagrams and talk about 2 dimensional boxes (rectangles) rather than 3
dimensional boxes however quite literally to add the 3rd dimension you
just need to add in the 3rd dimension. Wherever x and y apply in the
below add in z following the same pattern as for x and y. Hopefully
that is clear in the sample code but if you have any questions you can
always reach out on Twitter.

### What are AABBs?

AABBs are simpler than they sound – they are essentially boxes who’s
axes (so x,y for 2d and x,y,z for 3d) align / run in the same
direction. The bounding part of the name is because when used for
collision detection or as part of a tree they commonly contain, or
bind, other boxes. The diagram below shows two simple and compatible
AABBs:

![](aabbr1.jpg)

In contrast the two boxes shown in the diagram below are not AABBs as
their axes do not align:

![](aabbr2.jpg)

A key characteristic of an AABB is that the space it occupies can be
defined by 2 points irrespective of whether it is in a 2 or 3
dimensional space. In a 2 dimensional space the 2 points are (minx,
miny) and (maxx, maxy).

This can be used to perform a very fast check as to whether or not two
AABBs intersect. Consider the two AABBs in the diagram below:

![](aabbr3.jpg)

In this diagram we have two AABBs defined by a pair of points and the
result of the following expression can determine whether or not they
intersect:

```
maxx1 > minx2 && minx1 < maxx2 && maxy1 > miny1 && miny1 < maxy2
```

An important point to note about that expression is that it is made up
of a series of ands which means that evaluation will stop as soon as
one of the condition fails.

I’m fortunate working in a engine in that objects in my game world are
naturally axis aligned: [objects] essentially being 3d pixels or tiny
cubes. However what if your objects aren’t naturally aligned or are
made up of shapes other than boxes? This is where the bounding part of
the AABB comes in as you need to create a bounding box that
encompasses the complex shape as shown in the diagram below:

![](aabbr4.jpg)

Obviously testing the AABBs for an intersection will not result in
pixel perfect collision detection but remember the primary goal of
using AABBs is in the broad range part of the process. Having quickly
and cheaply determined that the two AABBs in the diagram above do not
intersect we can save ourselves the computational expense of trying to
figure out if two complex shapes intersect.

### The AABB Tree

Using the above approach you can see how we can quickly and easily
test for collisions between two objects in your world space however
what if you have 100 objects? Or 1000? No matter how efficient the
individual tests comparing 1000 AABBs against themselves is going to
be an expensive operation and highly wasteful.

This is where the AABB tree comes in. It allows us to organise and
index our AABBs to minimise the number of AABB intersection tests that
need to be made by slicing the world up using, guess what, more AABBs.

If you’ve not come across them before trees are incredibly useful
hierarchical data structures and there are many variants on the basic
concept (if such things interest you an excellent, if quite formal,
book on the subject is Introduction to Algorithms) and before
continuing it’s worth gaining a basic knowledge of the structure and
terminology from this Wikipedia article.

In the case of the AABB tree presented here the root, branch and
leaves have some very specific properties:

- Branch – Our branches always have exactly two children (known as left
  and right) and are assigned an AABB that is large enough to contain
  all of it’s descendants.
  
- Leaf – Our leaves are associated with a game world object and through
  that have an AABB. A leaf’s AABB must fit entirely within it’s parents
  AABB and due to how our branches are defined that means it fits in
  every ancestors AABB.
  
- Root – Our root may be a branch or a leaf

The best way to illustrate how this works is through a worked example.

### Constructing an AABB Tree

Imagine we have an empty world, and so at this point our tree is
empty, to which we are adding our first object. As our tree is
currently empty we create a leaf node that corresponds to our new
object and shares its AABB and assign that leaf to be the root:

![](aabbr5.jpg)

Now we add a second object to our world, it doesn’t intersect with our
first node, and something interesting happens to our tree:

![](aabbr6.jpg)

When we added the second object to our game world a number of things occurred:

1. We created a branch node for our tree and assigned it an AABB that is large enough to contain both object (1) and object (2).
1. We created a new leaf node for object (2) and attached it to our new branch node.
1. We took our original leaf node for object (1) and attached it to our new branch node.
1. We made the new branch node the root of the tree.

Ok. Let’s add another object to the game world and this time we’ll
have it intersect with an existing object:

![](aabbr7.jpg)

Again when we added this object some interesting things happened to
our tree:

1. We created a new branch node (b) and assigned it an AABB that encompassed objects (1) and (3).
1. We created a new leaf node for object (3) and assigned it to branch (b).
1. We moved leaf node (1) to be a child of branch node (b) and attached this new branch node (b) branch node (a).
1. This is subtle but important: we adjusted the AABB assigned to branch node (a) so that it accounts for the new leaf node. If we hadn’t done that the AABB assigned to branch node a would no longer have been big enough to contain the AABBs of its descendants.

Essentially every time we add a new game world object we manipulate
the tree so that the rules for branch and root nodes that I described
earlier still apply. This being the case we can describe a generic
process for adding a new game world object into the tree:

1. Create a leaf node for the object and assign it an AABB based on it’s associated object.
1. Find the best existing node (leaf or branch) in the tree to make the new leaf a sibling of.
1. Create a new branch node for the located node and the new leaf and assign it an AABB that contains both nodes (essentially combine the AABBs of the two located node and the new leaf).
1. Attach the new leaf to the new branch node.
1. Remove the existing node from the tree and attach it to the new branch node.
1. Attach the new branch node as a child of the existing nodes previous parent node.
1. Walk back up the tree adjusting the AABB of all of our ancestors to ensure they still contain the AABBs of all of their descendants.

Step 2 in the above does beg the question: how do you find the best
leaf in the tree to make the new leaf a sibling of? Essentially this
involves descending the tree and evaluating the likely cost of
attaching to the left or right of each branch you move through. The
better the decision you can make the more balanced the tree and the
cheaper the subsequent queries.

A common heuristic used here is to assign a cost to the surface area of the left and right nodes having been adjusted for the addition of the new leaf’s AABB and descend in the direction of the cheapest node until you find yourself on a leaf.

### Querying the AABB Tree

This is where all of our hard work pays off – it’s very simple and very fast. If we want to find all the possible collisions for a given AABB object all we need to do, starting at the root of the tree, is:

1. Check to see if the current node intersects with the test objects AABB.
1. If it does and if its a leaf node then this is a collision and so add it to the list of collisions.
1. If it does and it’s a branch node then descend to the left and right and recursively repeat this process.
1. At the end of the above your list will contain all the possible collisions for your test object and we will have minimised the number of AABB intersection checks we had to perform as we will not have descended down any pathways (and therefore all the subsequent children) that could not intersect with the test AABB tree.

In implementation it’s best not to actually use a recursive approach as this can get expensive (and could fail) on large trees. Instead just maintain a stack / list of nodes that are to be further explored  as follows:

1. Push the root node onto a stack (in C++ I use std::stack)
1. While the stack is not empty:
     1. Pop from the stack
     1. Check and see if the node intersects with the test AABB object
     1. If it does then either:
     	1. If it is a leaf node then this is a match for a collision. Add the leaf node (or its referenced object) to the list of collisions.
     	1. If it is a branch node then push the children (the left and right nodes) on to the stack.

Understanding how to iterate over trees none-recursively can be very
useful.

### Updating the AABB Tree

In most (but not all) scenarios involving collision detection at least
some of the objects in the world are moving. As the objects move that
does require the tree to be updated and this is accomplished by
removing the leaf that corresponds to the world object and reinserting
it.

This can be an expensive operation and you can minimise the number of
times you will need to do this if you express the movement of your
world objects using a velocity vector and use this to “fatten” the
AABB trees that you insert into the tree. For example take the object
in the diagram below, it has a (x,y) velocity of (1,0) and has had
it’s bounding AABB fattened accordingly:

![](aabbr8.jpg)

How much you fatten the AABB trees is a trade off between update cost,
predictability and broad range accuracy and you may need to experiment
to get the best performance.

Finally as trees are updated it is possible for them to become
unbalanced with some queries inappropriately requiring the traversal
of many more nodes than others. One technique for resolving this is to
rebalance the tree using rotations based on the height (depth from the
bottom) of each node. Another is to balance the tree based around how
evenly child nodes divide the parent nodes AABB. That’s slightly
beyond the scope of a beginners guide and I’ve not yet implemented it
myself in the sample code – however I may return to it at some point.

### Sample Code

Finally their is sample code that goes along with this blog post and
you can find it in my game engine. It’s pretty decoupled from the
engine itself and you should be able to use it in your own code
without too many problems. The key files are:

- [AABB.h](randall/AABB.h)
- [AABBTree.h](randall/AABBTree.h)
- [AABBTree.cpp](randall/AABBTree.cpp)
- [IAABB.h](randall/IAABB.h)
- [AABB.py](randall/AABB.py) (added by this blog, Python equivalent, conversion done by Google Gemini 2.5)

To use the tree you will need to add those four files to your project
and construct an instance of the AABBTree class – it’s constructor is
very simple and takes an initial size (the number of tree nodes to
reserve up front). Any object you want to add to the tree needs to
implement the IAABB interface that simply needs to return the AABB
structure when asked for. You can add, update and remove those objects
with the insertObject, updateObject and removeObject methods
respectively and you can query for collisions with the queryOverlaps
method.
